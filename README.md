# Exploring Interoperable Digital Fashion Wearables

## Intro

Welcome to our GitHub profile! We are a digital fashion/ wearables platform that creates hyper-realistic 3D digital wearables which can be worn on avatars across multiple metaverse platforms and online games. We are proud to showcase some of our work on this page and invite you to collaborate with us!

## 🥅 Our Goal

We aim to 

- Develop interoperable wearables that are compatible with different platforms and standards.
- Support a variety of use cases and scenarios.
- Enhance the user’s experience as well as the creator’s experience.
- Promote co-creation to develop the ecosystem as a whole.

## What interoperability is to us

We define interoperability in 3 stages:

  1. **Airdrops/Linked wearables:** Assets/NFT’s like wearables can be bought and used in as many platforms possible using connected airdrops for NFT’s

  2. **API Integration:** API that works with multiple metaverse platforms allowing
seamless exchange of information on their assets where users can move smoothly from one virtual world to another
  3. **Open Standards:** Universal Standards & Open-Source Technology implementation

## 🗺️ Our Projects and Roadmap

All our experiments and projects are for the greater goal of exploring that aspect and further developing it. We've shared some of our findings and research through some of our projects here

Our experiments and projects are for the greater goal of interoperable fashion in the metaverse. We’ve shared our findings and research through some of our projects such as:

  - **Virtual try ons** - A collection of 3d garments that anyone can virtually try on their photographs
  - **Metadrip** - A wearable NFT collection that can currently be used across 6 platforms. We unlock interoperability through experimentation
  - **WRBL** - Easy 3d garment creation service for multiple platforms
  - **Clonex Dresser** - A simple click to dress tool that we are building for the Clonex holders - and later many more avatar types.
 Please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions:

## 🌐 Community and growth

We believe that creators and developers are the pillars for realizing the metaverse we all have envisioned. Which is why we love spending a little time in growing the community and nurturing new talent. 

Here is a workshop series we conducted for creating digital wearables for the metaverse. We covered topics like garment creation using softwares like Clo3d/Marvelous designer and the entire process for creating game-ready assets for the metaverse. This was one of many to come
You can check the workshop series [here](https://)
