# Exploring Interoperable Digital Fashion Wearables

## Intro

Hello and welcome to our GitHub profile! We are a team of passionate digital fashion/wearable creators and developers who have been working on this field for over 3 years. Our platform enables you to design and wear hyper-realistic 3D digital wearables on your avatars across multiple metaverse platforms and online games. We believe in the power of interoperability and collaboration, and that‚Äôs why we have spent more than a year inviting developers to join us in this exciting journey. On this page, you can find some of our amazing projects and learn how to get involved with us!

## ü•Ö Our Goal

We aim to 

- Create high quality wearables that are compatible as per different platform formats.
- Collaborate with other industry experts to develop a standard for wearables
- Enable diverse and immersive use cases and scenarios.
- mprove the experience for both users and developers.
- Foster co-creation to grow the ecosystem together.

## What interoperability is to us

We define interoperability in 3 stages:

  ### 1. Airdrops/Linked wearables: 
  You can buy/claim and use wearables as NFTs on multiple platforms with connected airdrops and linked wearable systems.
      
  ### 2. API Integration:
  You can access a common API that works with different metaverse platforms and allows seamless exchange of information and assets. You can also move your wearables from one virtual world to another

  ### 3. Open Standards: 
  Universal Standards & Open-Source Technology that enable interoperability at the core level.

## üó∫Ô∏è Our Projects and Roadmap


All our experiments and projects are for the greater goal of achieving interoperable wearbables across the metaverse. We‚Äôve shared our findings and research through some of our projects such as:

  - ### Virtual Photoshoot (launched in 2021) 
    - A collection of hyper realistic digital fashion items that anyone can virtually try-on their photographs and publish acorss social media platfroms. Explore [here](https://github.com/xrcouture/interoperability/blob/main/VirtualTryOns.md)
